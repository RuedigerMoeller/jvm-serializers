My current results:

My modifications:

* The original project actually used the MINIMUM runtime for each benchmark thereby completely excluding GC related effects. 
I changed it to measure the average results of all runs (excluding warmup)

* I start a new VM for each benchmark run instead of running all in a single VM

* I limit test runs by time not by number of iterations

* I somewhat categorized serializers (full graph, generic, manually adoption, JSON/Binary, crossplatform ..). A lot of 
comparing apples and oranges is going on there ..

* beautified charts
